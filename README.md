# `sdc`

I switched Linux distros! And with that started making something I've been wanting to do for a while: a simple tool to install everything I need to get up and running. But not everything always.

## This is intended for my personal use

I won't stop you from using it yourself, but don't. Or do. idk. It should work either way.

## Running

just `npx @usermn/sdc`!
