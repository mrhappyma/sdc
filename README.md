# `sdc`

I switched Linux distros! And with that started making something I've been wanting to do for a while: a simple tool to install everything I need to get up and running. But not everything always.

## Building & Running

- clone the repo
- cd into it
- `pnpm install`
- `npx tsc`
- `npm install -g .`
- profit, you can now use the `sdc` command
