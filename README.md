# `sdc`

I switched Linux distros! And with that started making something I've been wanting to do for a while: a simple tool to install everything I need to get up and running. But not everything always.

## This is intended for my personal use

I won't stop you from using it yourself, but don't. Or do. idk. It should work either way.

## Building & Running

- clone the repo
- cd into it
- `pnpm install`
- `npx tsc`
- `npm install -g .`
- profit, you can now use the `sdc` command

you need npm/pnpm and node to run something that can install those?

I'm trying to get the node package sdc so that it can be run as `npx sdc` with just node :)
